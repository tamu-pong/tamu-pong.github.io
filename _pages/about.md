What We Do
=====
People in the Physical Oceanography Numerical Group (PONG) work on problems in the coastal ocean and estuaries using numerical simulations. The primary tool we use for simulations is the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). We are also big proponents of perceptually uniform colormaps ([cmocean](https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/)).

We have released a new package called [xroms](https://github.com/hetland/xroms), which contains functions for commonly used scripts for working with ROMS outputs in xarray. Examples include opening netcdf and zarr files, creation of an xgcm grid object, and density calculation.
